	First things first, I'd like to take this opportunity to mention that I am seeking employment as an artist, and would love for you to drop me a line!  (I am currently based in Australia but am considering relocation). I am dead serious about entering the games industry, and would love any opportunity to do so.

-- Notes --

	This model essentially uses every shader trick I could muster.  It probably also needs all the rendering power your card can muster, with the shader coming in at a whopping 7 stages.  :) 

	Obviously, the lava texture in this model was derived from a standard quake3 texture.  And for this reason, this model looks best when placed in a pool of that lava.

NOTE: This model looks particularly bizarre if viewed with vertex lighting rather than lightmap.

-- Thanks --

	Thanks to everyone over on #model_design!  Without them, this model would still have existed...  but they made the endless bouts with NPherno's tools much more tolerable.  

Special thanks go to: Shainiel, Cassar (also the remainder of Half-Brick) Ari, Janus, MTE, Sec, R3koil and everyone else who's names I've forgotten.
